## Identifying the Stage and Conditions for Peak Tumor Size.
```{r echo = FALSE, message = F}
#install library
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(plotly)
library(rcompanion)
#import and read dataframe
my_data = read.csv("breast_cancer.csv")
T1_data <- my_data[my_data$T.Stage == "T1", ]
T2_data <- my_data[my_data$T.Stage == "T2", ]
T3_data <- my_data[my_data$T.Stage == "T3", ]
T4_data <- my_data[my_data$T.Stage == "T4", ]
N1_data <- my_data[my_data$N.Stage == "N1", ]
N2_data <- my_data[my_data$N.Stage == "N2", ]
N3_data <- my_data[my_data$N.Stage == "N3", ]
A1_data <- my_data[my_data$A.Stage == "Regional",]
A2_data <- my_data[my_data$A.Stage == "Distant",]
```

### Figure 1: Tumor size comparison by N stage

```{r echo = FALSE}
fig <- plot_ly(my_data, y = ~Tumor.Size, color = ~N.Stage, type = "box")
fig <- fig %>%
          layout(
        title = "Tumor Size Comparison by N Stage",
        xaxis = list(title = "N Stage"),
        yaxis = list(title = "Tumor Size (mm)")
      )
  

fig
```

From the box plots, N3 stages have the biggest median tumor sizes, which alligns with the expectation that more advanced lymph node involvement can be associated with larger primary tumor. The presence of outliers in all stages also highlights the variability in tumor sizes within each N stage.

### Figure 2: Tumor size comparison by T stage

```{r echo = FALSE}
fig <- plot_ly(y = T1_data$Tumor.Size, name = "T1", type = "violin", box = list(
      visible = T
    ),
    meanline = list(
      visible = T
    ),) %>%
        add_trace(y = T2_data$Tumor.Size, name = "T2") %>%
        add_trace(y = T3_data$Tumor.Size, name = "T3") %>%
        add_trace(y = T4_data$Tumor.Size, name = "T4") %>%
        layout(
        title = "Tumor Size Comparison by T Stage",
        xaxis = list(title = "T Stage"),
        yaxis = list(title = "Tumor Size (mm)")
      )
fig

```


From the violin plots, The T3 stage having the highest median tumor size is noteworthy. This suggests that, patients in the T3 stage tend to have larger tumors on average compared to other stages.


### Figure 3: Relationship between Regional Node Positivity and Tumor Size

```{r echo = FALSE}
p <- ggplot(my_data, aes(y = Tumor.Size , x = Reginol.Node.Positive)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkgreen") + 
  geom_point(aes(x = mean(Reginol.Node.Positive), y = mean(Tumor.Size)), color = "orange", size = 5) +
  labs(title = "") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ x") +
ylab("Tumor size (mm)") + xlab("Regional Node Positivity") + labs(title = "Relationship between Regional Node Positivity and Tumor Size")
ggplotly(p)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
correlation =round(cor(my_data$Tumor.Size, my_data$Reginol.Node.Positive), 2)
correlation

line <- lm(my_data$Tumor.Size ~ my_data$Reginol.Node.Positive)
ln = line$coefficients
ln
```
\[Correlation = 0.24      \text{                   (weak positive correlation)}\]

\[y = 1.002x + 26.309     \text{                   (where x = Regional Node positivity and y = Tumor size (mm))}\]
In summary, there is a weak positive correlation in the data, showing that for each node detected to be positive, tumor size increase approximately 1.002 (mm).

### Figure 4: Residual graph of tumor size ~ Regional node positivity

```{r echo = FALSE}
line = lm(my_data$Tumor.Size ~ my_data$Reginol.Node.Positive, data = my_data)
p <- ggplot(line, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkgreen") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype ="dashed", colour = "orange") + ylab("Residual") + xlab("Regional Node Positivity") + labs(title = "Residual graph of tumor size ~ Regional node positivity")

ggplotly(p)
```

However, judging by the residual plots given here, the linear model is not a great fit as it is not homoscedastic. This might implies weak correlation.

## Hypothesis testing( Two Sample T Test at the 5% significance level)

```{r echo = FALSE}
grouped_data <- my_data %>%
    group_by(A.Stage) %>%
    summarise(Mean = mean(Tumor.Size), SEM = sd(Tumor.Size) / sqrt(n()))
plot_1 <- plot_ly(y = A2_data$Tumor.Size, name = "Distant", type = "box") %>%
        add_trace(y = A1_data$Tumor.Size, name = "Regional" ) %>%
        layout(
        title = "",
        xaxis = list(title = "A Stage"),
        yaxis = list(title = "Tumor Size (mm)")
      )

plot_2 <- plot_ly(grouped_data, x = ~A.Stage, y = ~Mean, type = 'bar', error_y = ~list(array = SEM, color = "orange"), marker = list(color = "lightblue")) %>%
    layout(title = "",
           xaxis = list(title = "Stage"),
           yaxis = list(title = "Average Tumor Size"))

subplot(plot_1, plot_2, nrows = 1)
```

Looking at the boxplots generated, there is a clear trend that patients with distant cancer have larger tumors. To investigate whether this correlation is due to chance or not, we use two sample T-test at the 5% significant level.

## Statisitcal Analyses

### Linear modelling

Linear modelling was chosen to demonstrate the association between tumor size and regional Node positivity . Assumption tests:

* "Eye-test". The relationship are not linear (Figure 3), however due to with large sample size normality is assumed (\(n = 4024\))

* Residual plots (Figure 4): the linear model is not a great fit as it is not homoscedastic. This might implies weak correlation.

### Hypothesis testing( Two Sample T Test at the 5% significance level)
#### Set up research question
Does A stage impact the tumor size of patients?

**H: Hypothesis \(H_{0}\) vs \(H_{1}\)**

Let $\mu_{1}$ is the mean of the tumor size of distant in A stage.

Let $\mu_{2}$ is the mean of the tumor size of regional in A stage.

Thus,
\[ H_{0} \text{: There is no difference between } \mu_{1} and \mu_{2}(\mu_{1} = \mu_{2})\]

\[ H_{1} \text{: There is a difference between } \mu_{1} and \mu_{2}(\mu_{1} \neq \mu_{2})\]


#### Weigh up evidence 

##### A: Assumption {.tabset .tabset-fade .unnumbered}

* Assuming that two sample are independent and they are big enough to present the hole population.

* The report assume that the 2 populations have the same variation in tumor size.
```{r echo = FALSE}
var.test(A2_data$Tumor.Size, A1_data$Tumor.Size)
```

* The report assume that the 2 populations have Normally distributed tumor size.

* QQ plots. Generally, the values increase linearly, suggesting normal distribution. Some deviation is observed at the extremities; however, due to the large sample size normality is assumed, as stated in central limit theoreom. (Figure 5, 6)

###### Figure 5 { .unnumbered}
```{r echo = FALSE}
a1 <- qqnorm(A2_data$Tumor.Size)
```

###### Figure 6 { .unnumbered}
```{r echo = FALSE}
a2 <- qqnorm(A1_data$Tumor.Size)
```

##### T: Test statistic and P: P-value { .unnumbered}

```{r echo = FALSE}
t.test(A1_data$Tumor.Size, A2_data$Tumor.Size, var.equal = T)
```

#### Explain conclusion

**Statistical conclusion:**

As the p-value < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.

**Scientific conclusion: **

The data suggest that A stage have effect on the tumor size.


## Limitations 

* In the assumption, we assume that 2 populations have Normally distributed tumor size, however, from the QQ plots, some deviation is observed at the extremities (Figure 5, 6)

* Week correlation between Regional Node Positivity and Tumor Size (Figure 4)

* Influence of Other Prognostic Factors

* Variability in Measurement
